**Note**

* This works well with only the  [pcb demo video file](../../VideoIngestion/test_videos/pcb_d1999.avi).
* For camera usecase, proper tuning needs to be done to have the proper model built and used for inference.
* pcb_filter and  pcb_classifier udfs expects the frame resolution to be `1920x1200`.
